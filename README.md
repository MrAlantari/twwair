# Laboratory: Technologie webowe w aplikacjach Internetu Rzeczy.

## Information
Due to the nature of the classes and the fact that I do not want to log in to GitHub at the University, each commit will be made with a finished project for a given lab.

The project is made in TypeScript using nodeJS, express and mongoDB.

## Installation
1. Clone repository
2. Inside the api/ folder open CMD or Terminal and type 'npm install'
3. Set environment variables:
    - On Windows type:
        ```
        set USER_LOGIN=value
        set USER_PASSWORD=value
        ```
    - On macOS or Linux:
        ```
        export USER_LOGIN=value
        export USER_PASSWORD=value
        ```
   Replace value with your account's login and password.
4. There are three ways to run project:
    - Run normally:
        `npm run`
    - Run in development mode:
        `npm run dev`
    - Watch for file changes:
        `npm run watch`
